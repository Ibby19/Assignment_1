Rolling multi-sided dice

Description of the task
A normal die (the singular of dice) is a cube, and each face shows a number from one to six. 
Some games employ nonstandard dice that may have fewer (e.g. four) or more (e.g. thirteen) sides. 
Letâ€™s design a general class MSDie to model multi-sided dice. 
We could use such an object in any number of simulation or game programs. Each MSDie object will know two things:

How many sides it has
Its current value
When a new MSDie is created, specify how many sides it will have (e.g n). 
The die can be operated on through three provided methods: roll, 
to set the die to a random value between 1 an n, exclusively; setValue, 
to set the die to a specific value (i.e cheat); and getValue to see what current value is.
